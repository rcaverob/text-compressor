# Text Compressor
This is a Java program that can compress text files using [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). I made it as a project for the Object Oriented Programming class at Dartmouth College.

## What I did
Implemented the `HuffManEncoding` and `HuffmanDriver` classes utilizing the provided `BufferedBitReader` and `BufferedBitWriter` classes.
